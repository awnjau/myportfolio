    <div class="div-16a">
      <p> This is a website that takes you through the lore of love according to Greek mythology made for no reason other than interest. Filled with quotes from books/poetry and my own analysis, the website was made for those
      who are even the slightest bit invested in this random, yet interesting topic. </p>

      <a href="https://awnjau.github.io/finalproject/">Blackfishing and Cultural Appropriation of Blackness Online</a>
      </div>
      <div class="div-17a">
        <p> I built this with the intention of creating an informational and artistic gallery that not only explains how black culture is stolen and appropraited online, but
        also shares and celebrates black creators. Everything on the website, from the poems, to the photography to the music, was made by black people, which I think is pretty neat :) </p>
